Below is the terminal output resulting from running the
install.sh script I downloaded from
https://github.com/nRF24/RF24/blob/master/docs/linux_install.md

(To get install.sh onto my Pi using my SSH shell, I had to execute:
(pi@raspberrypi:~/myRF24 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nRF24/.github/main/installer/install.sh > install.sh
(For some unknown reason trying to use wget didn't work - wget just kept timing out. I tried wget on my
(desktop PC and worked just fine. And could do a ping to that domain on the Pi and that worked just fine;
(I could even wget a tiny file at google and that worked fine. But this install.sh file just kept
timing out.)
